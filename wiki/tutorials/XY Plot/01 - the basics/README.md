# Tutorials / XY Plot: 01 - the basics

In this first tutorial, we are going to generate our first grids, using the 2 standard XY Plot nodes.
We will also play with pagination, row / column header templates, and switch rows / headers as we wish.

To keep it simple, we will not detail the core concepts here. But if you are interested, now or later, you can check the [dedicated page](../../../node%20reference/xy%20plot/00%20-%20core%20concepts.md)

And as always, if you do not want to follow all the steps, you can jump directly to [the conclusion](#tldr--conclusion).
