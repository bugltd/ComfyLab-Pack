# ComfyLab-Pack wiki

Welcome to the wiki of the ComfyLab-Pack!

Here you will find plenty of information / tricks to help you discover the nodes, and use them efficiently.

Please take the time to read the pages if you face difficulties, and before [creating an issue](https://github.com/bugltd/ComfyLab-Pack/issues).

Apart from these pages, I also customized most of the labels and tooltips.\
You can get **useful contextual information in tooltips**, by just hovering (putting the mouse pointer) over the node title, or inputs / widgets / outputs. It's not perfect, but should be enough in the most standard cases.

> If you can, do not hesitate to propose a Pull Request to improve this wiki, and benefit to the community:\
> English is not my native language, so there is certainly a lot to do to improve it.

That being said, have a good read, dear friends!
